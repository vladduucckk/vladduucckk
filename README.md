I have experience developing the backend of web applications using Python with frameworks such as Django, Flask, and FastAPI. As an ORM, I use Django ORM or SQLAlchemy (for Flask and FastAPI).
I develop RESTful applications using Django REST Framework (DRF) for Django and Flask-RESTful for Flask and create technical documentation with Swagger.
Additionally, I have backend development experience with PHP.
For testing, I use Pytest and Unittest or Postman (for API testing).

Additional tools I use for backend development include Redis, RabbitMQ, and Celery.
When web scraping is needed, I work with BeautifulSoup4 and Requests.
For browser automation, I use Selenium and Playwright.

For containerization, I work with Docker and Kubernetes.
I have a solid understanding of UNIX-based systems (Linux, macOS), including Bash/Shell scripting.
I have deployed Python projects on hosting platforms.
I am proficient in version control tools such as Git and GitHub.
I have knowledge of the application layer of TCP/IP, including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP, and SSH.

Regarding frontend technologies, I work with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and AlpineJS.
For databases, I use PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, as well as MongoDB for projects that require NoSQL solutions.
