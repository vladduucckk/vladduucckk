I am a backend developer specializing in Python, with a strong focus on Django and Flask for web development. 
I work with a variety of databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, and I also use MongoDB for NoSQL data storage.
I have extensive experience with web scraping using tools like BeautifulSoup (bs4), Requests, and Selenium. 
Iâ€™m comfortable with version control through Git and GitHub, as well as automation with Bash/Shell.
I also have a solid understanding of Django Rest Framework, Postman for API testing and use Docker for containerization.
When it comes to testing, I rely on Unittest and Pytest. While my primary focus is backend development, I also work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for frontend tasks.
