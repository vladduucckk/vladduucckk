I specialize in backend development for web applications using Python and frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI, leveraging Django ORM or SQLAlchemy for database management. My expertise includes building RESTful APIs with DRF (Django) and flask-restful (Flask), complemented by technical documentation using Swagger.

In testing, I utilize Pytest and Unittest, while my web scraping projects involve BeautifulSoup4, Requests, and Selenium for browser task automation. I am experienced in containerization with Docker and Kubernetes and possess strong knowledge of UNIX systems (Linux, macOS), including Bash/Shell scripting.

My deployment experience includes hosting Python projects on platforms like PythonAnywhere. I am skilled in Git and GitHub for version control and have practical knowledge of network protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SMTP, and SSH.

On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Additionally, my commercial experience as an analyst includes working with relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB in relevant projects.
